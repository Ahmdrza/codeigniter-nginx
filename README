CodeIgniter Nginx Configuration
--------------------------------
This setup adds a little bit more security by sharing only the index.php front controller on the web.

The reason for the "shared" and "current" folders is because I use Capistrano (www.capify.org) for deployment.
The "current" folder contains the latest deployed code.
The "shared" folder contains logs that persist between deployments.
I symlink the "current/system/logs/" folder into the "shared/logs/" folder.

To keep this brief I have skipped explaining my full Capistrano and dynamic assets setup.
For a basic CodeIgniter app this should do the job.

Instructions
-------------
First we need to make the following changes to our CodeIgniter folder structure:
	* Start in the base folder of the CodeIgniter install, with the following default structure:
		* index.php
		* license.txt
		* system/
			* application/
			* ...
		* user_guide/
	* Create a "public" folder
	* Move index.php into the public folder
	* Create an "assets" folder in the public folder.
		* Stick all your CSS, JS and images into this folder
	* Move the system/application folder outside of the system folder
	* Our folder structure should now look like this:
		* application/
		* license.txt
		* public/
			* assets/
			* index.php
		* system/
		* user_guide/

Now to update the CodeIgniter config:
	* Open public/index.php
	* Change $system_folder to "../system"
	* Change $application_folder to "../application"
